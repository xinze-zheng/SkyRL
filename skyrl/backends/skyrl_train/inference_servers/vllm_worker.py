"""
vLLM Worker Extension for SkyRL weight synchronization.

This module provides WorkerWrap, a vLLM worker extension class that enables
efficient NCCL-based and CUDA IPC-based weight updates from the training
process to inference workers.

TODO: This will be removed once vLLM natively supports weight sync APIs.
See: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/31848

Usage:
    Pass as --worker-extension-cls to vLLM:

    vllm serve ... --worker-extension-cls skyrl_train.inference_servers.vllm_worker.WorkerWrap
